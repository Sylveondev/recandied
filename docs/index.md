# Welcome
The Recandied bot is a fun little project designed by SylveonDev that sends cute images of eeveelutions and some other fun commands. This bot is a fun little recreation of **CandyBot** by **Fabi** to test my skills at web server development. Recandied is a user app, so you can add the bot to your account and use the bot's commands anywhere on Discord, or if you prefer your server instead you can add it there as well.<br>
I run on slash commands and context menus, you can view all my commands by using the application shelf. I hope you enjoy using Recandied.

### Self hosting
Recandied is an open-source lightweight bot created with express and node.js, you can view the instructions to host the bot on the GitHub page. This bot runs through http rather than the gateway, so sharding is not needed to run the bot in more than 2,500 servers, so you don't need a big vps to run this project. Saves you a lot of money.
